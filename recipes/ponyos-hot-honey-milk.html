      Ponyo’s Hot Honey Milk is comforting and warm – perfect for rainy day,
      just like in the film!

      Next in my Studio Ghibli recipe series is another highly requested one!
      Ponyo’s Hot Honey Milk.

    <h2>Some delicious additions</h2>
    <p>
      In the movie, Sosuke’s mother only puts honey in the milk. While this is
      yummy on it’s own, I like adding a small dash of cinnamon for some extra
      depth to the drink. Most of my Ghibli dishes I try to keep as close to the
      movie as possible, but I just had to add cinnamon to this because I really
      feel it takes it to the next level. Some followers recommended adding a
      splash of vanilla or even sweet butter to this drink! The hot honey milk
      base is pretty simple in flavor so I’m sure there are tons of delicious
      ways to customize and have fun with this drink!
