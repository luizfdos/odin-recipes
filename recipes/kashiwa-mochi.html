      Celebrate Children’s Day with this Kashiwa Mochi recipe: a traditional
      Japanese sweet rice cake with red bean filling and wrapped in an oak leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making mochi may seem like a difficult task but with the right ingredients
      and modern techniques, it’s actually quite easy!
    </p>
    <h2>What is Kashiwa Mochi?</h2>
    <p>
      Kashiwa Mochi is a type of mochi, a traditional Japanese confection that
      is a chewy, sweet rice cake. Typically, it’s filled with koshi-an or anko,
      a smooth, sweet red bean paste. Sometimes, you can find Kashiwa Mochi with
      a shiro-an (white bean paste) & miso filling. The mochi is then wrapped in
      an oak leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oak leaf is not edible or meant to be eaten but gives the mochi a
      wonderful fragrance. It is mostly meant for symbolism as Kashiwa Mochi is
      typically eaten for Kodomo-no-Hi, or Children’s Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oak leaf symbolizes prosperity for children and families as oak trees
      don’t shed their leaves until new ones grow in.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3.5 oz joshinko rice flour</li>
      <li>1 tbsp corn starch or potato starch</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>4 tbsp koshi-an sweet red bean paste</li>
      <li>4 pickled oak leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse pickled oak leaves and dry with a paper towel or towel. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>In a bowl, add joshinko, corn starch, and sugar. Mix to combine.</li>
      <li>Add water and mix until combined fully.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for 30 seconds. Mix
        the mochi mixture. Microwave again on high for 30 seconds. Then mix the
        mixture again. Repeat once again (for a total of 3 times, or 1 min 30
        seconds).
      </li>
      <li>
        *You can skip this step if you don't have anything to pound the mochi*
        Using a pestle, dip in water and pound the mochi so it becomes glossy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the mochi has cooled slightly, transfer to a surface that is dusted
        with corn starch. Knead the mochi with wet hands until the surface is
        glossy and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the mochi into an even log and cut into 4 even pieces. Roll each
        piece into a round ball and set aside. Cover the mochi balls with a damp
        towel so they don't dry out.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a small rolling pin, roll one mochi out into an oblong/oval shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one tbsp of red bean paste and roll it into a ball. Place it in the
        center of the rolled out mochi. Fold the mochi over to close and pinch
        around the edges to seal and mold into a nice shape.
      </li>
      <li>Wrap the mochi in an oak leaf (vein-side facing out).</li>
      <li>Repeat for the rest of the mochi and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
