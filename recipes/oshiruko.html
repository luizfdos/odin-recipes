    <p>
      Oshiruko, sweet red bean soup with mochi, is so delicious that you will
      want to keep it away from Big Mom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oshiruko has been making it’s way around the internet lately thanks to the
      popular anime One Piece. Seeing Otama enjoying the dish with happy tears
      in her eyes to Big Mom fervently chasing after it, it has left people
      wondering “What the heck is Oshiruko??”
    </p>
    <h2>What is Oshiruko?</h2>
    <p>
      Oshiruko (also sometimes known as Zenzai), is a traditional Japanese
      dessert soup made with sweet azuki beans and mochi (rice cake). It’s warm,
      slightly sweet, earthy, and the chewy mochi adds extra texture. While it’s
      a wintertime dessert, many people enjoy eating it year round!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shiratama Dango (Mochi)</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>1/3 c shiratamako</li>
        <li>3-5 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Oshiruko Soup</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup tsubu-an (anko – red bean paste)</li>
        <li>pinch salt</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>To make Shiratama Dango</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, put in the shiratamako, water, and sugar. Mix and once the
        mixture starts sticking together, use your hands and knead the mixture
        into a smooth ball. The amount of water will depend on how dry it is in
        your kitchen so add water little by little until everything sticks
        together and the ball holds together smoothly without cracking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the ball of dough into a log. Break the log into about 6
        equal-sized pieces and roll each piece into small balls (dango). Use
        your thumb to slightly indent the middles of each dango.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil water in a pot. Once boiling, drop in the dango and carefully push
        them around to make sure they don't stick to the bottom. Boil for about
        2 minutes and the dango are floating.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the floating dango and put them in an ice bath. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To make the soup</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a pot on medium-high heat, add the water, anko, and salt. Mix well
        until combined completely. Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat
        slightly and cook until the mixture reduces slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the prepared soup into bowl and place the prepared dango into the
        soup.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
